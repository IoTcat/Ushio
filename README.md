# Ushio
IoTcat's personal distributed information support system    

[简体中文（推荐）](./zh.md)

## What is the meaning of Ushio
Ushio named after the daughter of the protagonist of Clannad. On July 18, 2019, the first studio of Kyoto Animation was set on fire, and the most tender group of people received the most cruel treatment. All I can do is pass on the spirit these people conveys. I hope to find my true self with the help of Ushio system. To find the responsibility that truly belongs to me; to find the happiness that truly belongs to me; to find the person who is truly worthy of my all-out efforts.

## Project positioning
The Chinese meaning of word Ushio is the gushing water at dusk. The idea of the Ushio system is that it can be deployed on various devices in a distributed and flexible manner, providing a tool set, operating environment, and maintenance path for my development activities. If the interdependence between the various services I developed is a spider web, then the Ushio system is the architect and maintainer of this web. In addition, some Ushio interfaces are developed and shared to the public through API. See [iotcat/ushio-api](https://github.com/iotcat/ushio-api) for details.

## Implementation

### The first generation of ushio [iotcat/ushio-cn-old:old](https://github.com/IoTcat/Ushio-cn-old/tree/old)
The first architecture was completed in July 2019. It was integrated a series of applications on the CentOS7 system of the cn.yimian.xyz server. At this time, the local file system of the host is still used.

### The second generation ushio [iotcat/ushio-linux](https://github.com/IoTcat/ushio-linux)
The second reconstruction was completed in March 2020. It was run by a Ushio user, with onedrive as the file system and the local storage as the cache system, with independent system partitions and a Linux subsystem with isolated permissions.

### The third generation ushio [iotcat/ushio-cn](https://github.com/iotcat/ushio-cn)
The third reconstruction was completed in June 2020. It was run by the root user, with onedrive as the file system, the local storage as the cache system, and a docker cluster controlled by docker-compose.

### The fourth generation ushio
The fourth reconstruction is in progress and is expected to be completed before 2020.12. On the basis of the third generation, Kubernetes and Helm are used to replace docker-compose for elastic process management, DroneCI and Github are used for continuous integration, and Kafka is used for cross-regional cluster communication.


## Design Objective
- Reliable
- Fast
- Safe
- Integrated
- Extensible
- OpenSource
- Smart

## Development Method
- Continuous reconstruction, iterative development
- Development-oriented
- Taking into account the development of quantum computing, AES256 will be mainly used and the use of RSA will be reduced


# Architecture and standards

## File system

Ushio uses git with git.yimian.xyz to manage configuration files, secret keys, credentials, database passwords, and static files that require high access speed. In addition, Ushio uses onedrive to store static files that take up a lot of space, such as video files. Ushio uses Huawei Cloud Storage to store shared files that require high-speed access between cross-regional clusters, such as certain data files. At the same time, Ushio uses the host disk to store log files, run caches and other dynamic files.

The general structure of the Ushio file system is as follows, where the `/onedrive` directory and the `/mnt/var` directory are shared and synchronized by all Ushio hosts. The `/home` directory, the `/mnt/etc` directory, the `/mnt/config` directory, and the `/mnt/docker` directory use git for management and disaster recovery, which facilitates version control and quick recovery. `/var` and `/tmp` use the system root directory address to store dynamic files and cache.

```
|Ushio-fs
|
|---|onedrive (mount using rclone)
|
|---|mnt (IoTcat/ushio-private)
|   |---config (Shared configuration file)
|   |---etc (shared local configuration file)
|   |---docker (sharing docker-compose configuration file)
|   |---var (Share Huawei Cloud Storage)
|
|---|home (with git management)
|   |---www (local high-speed website files, such as php)
|   |---opt (local development file)
|   |---lib (local shared library)
|
|---|var
|   |---log (local log)
|   |---cache (local cache)
|
|---|tmp (temporary file)
```
## Cross-regional communication
The Ushio cluster communicates data through Huawei cloud storage, mqtt distributed cluster, and Kafka message queue (to be implemented).
