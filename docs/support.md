# Sponsor Ushio Development

Ushio is an Apache licensed partially open-source project and completely free to use. However, the amount of effort needed to maintain and develop new features for the project is not sustainable without proper financial backing.

If you run a business and are using some tools or APIs in a revenue-generating product, it makes business sense to sponsor Ushio development: it ensures the project that your product relies on stays healthy and actively maintained.

If you are an individual user and have enjoyed the productivity of using Ushio, consider donating as a sign of appreciation - like buying me coffee once in a while :)

You can support Ushio development via the following methods:
